# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The assignment this week was to create a mobile app using React Native.
We could choose between three different projects and I chose to create an app using the mobile sensors.

So my app gives movie tips based on an API when the phone is shaken.
## The problem

My biggest issue this week has mainly been a lack of concentrated time with a sick kid at home all week.
But I tried to be more effective in the little time I had and do the best under those conditions. 

I started by using the useEffect hook for the fetching but realised that it looked bad that the app produced a movie suggestion on mounting rather than on the first shake. So I ended up removing the useEffect and doing the fetch without it.

The biggest issues I faced, besides learning how to set everything up, was probably getting started and to feel comfortable in the code environment (using the accelerometer). But once I got started it went better.

I've been googling a lot and reading the documentation for the styling which (albeit is basic) still required some digging for information.
If I would have had more time I would have added routing and prettified it more, it's a bit more basic than I'd like.
